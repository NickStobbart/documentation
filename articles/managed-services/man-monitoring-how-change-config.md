# How to change your service configuration for Managed Monitoring from UKCloud

## Overview

With Managed Monitoring from UKCloud, our Network Operations Centre (NOC) monitors your devices, receiving and reacting to any abnormal events, only escalating those events that genuinely require your attention.

When we first provision the service, we set it up with default thresholds for the devices you've selected to monitor, unless you specified different thresholds in your initial request. At any time, you can raise a Service Request to change these thresholds and other service configuration details.

This article provides information about the default monitoring thresholds and alerting procedures and shows you how to change your service configuration.

## Managed Monitoring from UKCloud default configuration

### Default monitoring thresholds

Managed Monitoring thresholds determine when alerts are raised against your monitored devices. The following table shows the default thresholds used by the service. If you want to use different thresholds you can identify these in your initial request or change them later.

Item                                | Alert type     | Default threshold
------------------------------------|----------------|------------------
Processor load                      | Major Alert    | 80%
Processor load                      | Critical Alert | 90%
Available memory                    | Major Alert    | 85%
Available memory                    | Critical Alert | 95%
Swap space used                     | Major Alert    | 80%
Global disk space used              | Major Alert    | 75%
Global disk space used              | Critical       | 85%
Specific Filesystem disk space used | Major Alert    | 75%
Specific Filesystem disk space used | Critical Alert | 85%

### Default alert handling procedures

If a threshold is exceeded, a major or critical alert is raised as appropriate. The procedure followed for these alerts is dependent on the alert type and whether you have identified the device as critical. The following table shows the default alert handling procedures for the different alert types and criticality.

Alert type     | Critical item | UKCloud action
---------------|---------------|---------------
Major Alert    | No            | <ol><li>Incident logged against the escalation contact via the UKCloud Portal.</li><li>Email notification to escalation contact with ticket details.</li><li>Ticket remains as "Waiting for Customer" until customer acknowledges and closes the incident via the UKCloud Portal.</li></ol>
Major Alert    | Yes           | As above.
Critical Alert | No            | As above.
Critical Alert | Yes           | <ol><li>Incident logged against the escalation contact via the UKCloud Portal.</li><li>Email notification to escalation contact with ticket details.</li><li>Ticket remains as "Waiting for Customer" until customer acknowledges and closes the incident via the UKCloud Portal.</li><li>Phone call to escalation contact, if no response then voicemail and update ticket with voicemail details.</li><ol>

## Making changes to your service configuration

To make any changes to your Managed Monitoring from UKCloud service, you must log a Service Request via the UKCloud Portal. For general information about raising a Service Request, see [*How to use My Calls in the UKCloud Portal*](../portal/ptl-how-use-my-calls.md).

If you want to make changes to more than one item, you'll be provided with a link to download a spreadsheet to specify the list of items that need amending. When filling out the spreadsheet, ensure that you fill in the correct tab, depending on the change required. If you want to download the file ahead of raising the request, click [here](https://cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com/Docs/Documents/UKC-FRM-257%20Managed%20Monitoring%20from%20UKCloud%20-%20%20make%20changes%20to%20my%20service.xlsx?AWSAccessKeyId=438-1048-5-aefff7-1&Expires=1608414781&Signature=jHVncOCED%2FOxxgc%2FKpKSGnJqQV8%3D). You can attach the file to the request offering before submitting to UKCloud.

You can change the following service configurations:

- [Add or remove a monitored device](#adding-or-removing-a-monitored-device)

- [Change escalation contact information](#changing-escalation-contact-information)

- [Change monitoring thresholds](#changing-monitoring-thresholds)

- [Provide advance notice of maintenance windows](#providing-notification-of-maintenance-windows)

- [Add, update or delete playbooks](#adding-updating-or-deleting-playbooks)

### Adding or removing a monitored device

If there's a new device that you want to add to your Managed Monitoring from UKCloud service, or if there's a device that you no longer want to be monitored, you can let us know by raising a Service Request.

1. In My Calls, raise a ticket using the **Add or Remove Monitored Devices** Managed Monitoring template.

2. From the **Action** list, select:

    - **Add New Device** to add a device to the service

    - **Remove Existing Device** to remove an item from the service

    - **Add New Device and Remove Existing** if you want to both add and remove devices
