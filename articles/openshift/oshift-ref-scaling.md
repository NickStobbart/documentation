# Considerations when scaling an OpenShift cluster

### Infrastructure applications

With your UKCloud for OpenShift cluster we deploy a number of infrastructure applications by default. These are quality of service features that are intended to help you with administration, management and application development within your cluster. Examples include the EFK stack, Hawkular Metrics, the integrated registry, the service catalog and, with v3.11 deployments onwards, Prometheus and Grafana.

These applications run their components on the infrastructure nodes (these are the nodes with the naming convention worker-infra). Your cluster comes out of the box with three of these nodes and each has 16GB of memory and two vCPUs. This provides an adequate amount of resource and good level of resiliency for the infrastructure components to support a production deployment. If you're looking to scale out the cluster to a larger size and start running more intensive applications or builds, these nodes may not be enough. For example, the more applications and nodes you have in your environment, the more logs will be gathered off the nodes by fluentd and sent off to Elasticsearch for indexing. This will result in significantly higher resource usage. In the same vein, the more pods and nodes that are running in your environment, the more stats Hawkular Metrics will be gathering and storing in the Cassandra database.

#### Recommendations

Scaling of the infrastructure applications to make them more resilient is possible but may require additional infrastructure nodes to be deployed. For example to scale Elasticsearch to three nodes/containers we recommend having a minimum of four infrastructure nodes. To have these applications scaled up or down raise a Service Request via the [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the UKCloud Portal.

Finally, you'll want to consider the storage usage of the infrastructure applications. As previously mentioned, the more applications and nodes you have in your environment the more logs will be gathered off the nodes by fluentd and sent off to Elasticsearch for indexing. This means the persistent volume used by Elasticsearch will have more data to store. By default, we provide 14 days retention and a 40GB persistent volume with Elasticsearch. If this volume fills to 100% then the EFK stack will not work until indices are deleted or more space is provided. If you're relying on the EFK stack for your logs then you'll want to determine an average of how much storage your cluster is consuming on logs per day and request an increase of the persistent volume to fit your desired retention.

### Planning your scale out

You'll want to estimate how many pods you are expecting to fit on a node. Things to take into account are the CPU, memory and storage (if your pod is going to be writing to the local file system rather than persistent storage) requirements of your applications. This will give you an idea of the size and amount of nodes you'll need. For more information regarding planning for application requirements, see the following OpenShift documentation page: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/scaling_performance/cluster_limits.html#scaling-performance-planning-your-environment-according-to-application-requirements

### Scaling

If you'd like to scale up your cluster, raise a Service Request via the [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the UKCloud Portal and provide us with the size, network connectivity and quantity of nodes you'd like to add. The same process should be followed to scale a cluster down, this time providing the details of the node(s) you want to remove.

> [!NOTE]
> The network connectivity you request for the scaled up nodes must be present in the cluster.
