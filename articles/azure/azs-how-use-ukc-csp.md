# How to use UKCloud as your public Azure CSP

## Overview

If you already consume UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, or another UKCloud core cloud service, UKCloud can act as your Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) for your public Azure environments. Benefits of using UKCloud as your public Azure CSP include:

- Azure advice from UKCloud experts

- A single invoice for all your Azure cloud services

- Access to our free 24x7 customer support

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing subscription that's not covered by a CSP (for example, an Enterprise Agreement subscription) this cannot be automatically used in your UKCloud public Azure environment. In this scenario, raise a service request so that we can contact you to discuss options, or speak to your Service Delivery Manager.

## Prerequisites

Before requesting to move to UKCloud as your public Azure CSP:

- You must already consume a UKCloud core cloud service

- You'll need to know your Azure Active Directory (AAD) Domain and AAD administrator email address so that we can request administrator permissions to act as your CSP

### Using UKCloud as a new CSP

If you don't already have a public Azure CSP, the process for setting this up is the same as our UKCloud for Microsoft Azure onboarding process. For more information, see the [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure*](azs-gs.md).

## Moving to UKCloud as your CSP

To move to UKCloud as your public Azure CSP you need to complete Microsoft's CSP transfer process.

1. Contact your Account Manager or Service Delivery Manager or raise a Service Request to request to move your public Azure CSP to UKCloud.

2. As soon as we confirm that you're eligible to use us as your public Azure CSP, you can start the process to transfer your Azure subscription.

    For details about what you need to do, see <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/switch-azure-subscriptions-to-a-different-partner>.

    Your Account Manager or Service Delivery Manager will provide you with details of what you need to enter in the New CSP Partner information section of the CSP Subscription Transfer form.

3. During the transfer process, you'll receive an email asking for permission for UKCloud to be your Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider. You need to authorise this for us to be able to complete the transfer.

    For more information, see the *How can I get started with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure?* section of the [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure*](azs-gs.md).
